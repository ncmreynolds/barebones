# Barebones

Barebones is an Arduino Library consisting of a minified version of the [original Barebones CSS framework](https://github.com/acahir/Barebones) and some Arduino helper functions to make creating user interfaces in ESPAsyncWebServer easier.

It is probably of little utility to anybody else so not shared to the Arduino Library Manager.
